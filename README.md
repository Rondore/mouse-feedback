# Mouse Feedback

This is a small algorithmic art project I made in college. It was originally created in Java. I ported it to TypeScript so that it could be used in the browser so nobody would need to install anything to try it out.

The original project only works with a mouse. This port adds support for touch interaction as long as the webpage it's on prevents scrolling interactions from intercepting the touch events.

You can see it in action [here](https://thegreatdivide.info/mouse/).
